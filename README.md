# CreativeStreams
 
Creative Streams was initially launched when Twitch removed the ability to discover channels through the use of hashtags, we felt the pain of the creative community and quickly put together a site where you could continue to discover channel using hashtags.

With the new generation of Creative Streams our aim was to provide a much better user experience through the power of a Single Page Application with react powering our frontend and PHP powering the backend for API calls.

**Note:** Dockerfile is currently and should only be used for local development.
