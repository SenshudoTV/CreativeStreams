# CreativeStreams
 
Creative Streams was initially launched when Twitch removed the ability to discover channels through the use of hashtags, we felt the pain of the creative community and quickly put together a site where you could continue to discover channel using hashtags.

With the new generation of Creative Streams our aim was to provide a much better user experience through the power of a Single Page Application with VueJS powering our frontend and PHP powering the backend for API calls.

## Why would we do this? Or What do we get out of this?

Honestly? Not much.

We believe that the Creative community is one of the most exciting and unique parts of Twitch. We know a whole bunch of you guys who are fantastically passionate and wonderful content creators. We also feel that losing the ability to effectively ‘multi-category’ your streams via hashtags has really put you in a bad spot.

We want to give you a home away from home to find each other more easily, find new faces more easily and more importantly, get found yourself. That’s all this is. We don’t gather any data for our purposes for doing this, there’s no sign-up, no fees, nothing. Any data we track from here is used to improve the service itself, and even then, that information is available via Twitch’s API.

All we get from this really is the knowledge that we’re helping you folks out. It’s rough as a gaming streamer as it is, let alone when you step into the more niche world of Creative. You deserve to be found, you deserve to be celebrated, you deserve to have people celebrate your creations.

All we hope, is that maybe you’ll take a peek at our main site over at [Senshudo](https://www.senshudo.tv) where we do gaming news & reviews as well as give you guys some analytics around your streams if you sign up (it’s pretty neat, promise!). You don’t have to, it’d be lovely if you did, but don’t feel obliged.

This did cost us a little to throw this together for you, if you were feeling especially generous, you’re welcome to throw a few pennies our way. Our servers cost us quite a bit for all the projects we run (a couple thousand a year) which we pay ourselves. Again, don’t feel obliged, we did this to help out however we can. Having our overheads for doing it covered would be nice, but not necessary.
